Our simulations were executed in **MATLAB&nbsp;R2023b** on a **MacBook Pro (M2, 32 GB RAM)**.

The timings in **Table&nbsp;1** and **Table&nbsp;2** pertain **only** to the *Algorithm&nbsp;1* scripts (`xxxxx_Algorithm_1`).  
By contrast, the network-level simulation scripts (`xxxxx_Network_Simulation`) can take **30 minutes or more** to complete, depending on the number of subsystems and the computational resources available.

> **RT** (running time) and **MU** (memory usage) measure the effort required to solve the SOS problem for *each* subsystem, as detailed in *Algorithm&nbsp;1*.
